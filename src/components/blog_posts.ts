"This week I decided to practice learning more about UI/UX by building my blog to look like a code editor. An issue that I have with many modern code editors is that they are very convoluted and hard for people to use. I decided to simplify the design of the code editor so that it could be more fit for displaying information. I plan on implementing new features and improving the stylistic choices made while creating this blog for the first few weeks. Eventually, I will experiment with ways to make websites more engaging by building components unrelated to this blog and posting them for people to test out."

 "This week I cleaned up the code for the blog to get it ready to support mobile devices. The thing I need to figure out next is how the website will look on a mobile screen. Thinking of a design that is responsive, functional and follows the whole aesthetic of the blog is something I'm currently struggling with."

 "My friends hate the design (maybe they just hate me), or rather, they don't appreciate the design. I feel like the code editor idea is a little too niche and it's something only I'd appreciate (because I spend 12 hours a day staring at it). I want to redesign my blog to be very minimalist and to run off of singular HTML page. I also want to give it character so that anybody can appreciate the design. I have a few ideas written down in my notebook, but it's cluttered with pictures of cats I drew so I don't really understand what I want to do."

"I have an idea for how the blog is going to look. I want it to have a minimalist/deconstructed feel. In doing so, I feel like I'm limiting myself from adding everything I want to it, so I'm going to have certain documentations on a seperate webpage. I want to try my best to have my design allow me to incorporate everything I want to show, but I feel like adding images to the blog will be a stark contrast from the design I'm trying to achieve."

const week_5 = ["Week 5",
"I finished creating the landing page for the new blog design. I added a little flare to it because I didn't want it to be completely dull and I added a little click animation before you actually enter the blog (there is no blog yet it takes too much time to code that portion and it took too much time to code this landing page). For the actual blog part itself, I am at a complete loss. I do not know how I want it to look and I don't know how I want it to work. I think the main issue is, I don't know how to make it work."
